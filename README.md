# Japanese akko

A Japanese immersion app that runs on your own computer. You can:

- **Watch** anime with Japanese subtitles (found automatically from kitsunekko.net)
- **Read** text and manga
- **Listen** to podcasts with transcripts
- Hover over any word to see its dictionary entry, kanji info and pitch accent
- Send words to **Anki** as flashcards

The dictionary works offline once it has been set up.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) **version 18 or newer** (the LTS version is recommended)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to download the project (or use **Code → Download ZIP** on GitHub)
- *Optional:* [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) with the **AnkiConnect** add-on, if you want to make flashcards

To check that Node.js is installed, open a terminal and run:

```
node --version
```

## Setup

1. **Download the project**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/JaoN64dev/japaneselocalwebapp.git
   cd japaneselocalwebapp
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies**

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the server**

   ```
   npm start
   ```

   You should see:

   ```
   Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000
   ```

4. **Open the app** at **http://127.0.0.1:3000** in your browser.

Keep the terminal open while you use the app. Press `Ctrl + C` in it to stop the server.

> Before you start watching, read the **keys** section in the app to learn the keyboard shortcuts.

## Dictionary data

The files in `data/` (dictionary, kanji and pitch accent) are already in the repository. If any of them are missing, the server downloads and builds them the first time it starts. This takes about a minute and needs an internet connection. The terminal shows the progress:

```
dictionary: … entries ready
kanji: … ready
pitch accent: … words ready
tokenizer: ready
```

Words can't be looked up until these lines appear.

## Anki (optional)

1. Install and open [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).
2. Go to **Tools → Add-ons → Get Add-ons…** and enter the code **`2055492159`** (AnkiConnect).
3. Restart Anki.

Anki must be open while you use the app. You don't need to change any AnkiConnect settings, because the app connects to it through the local server.

Cards can include a recording of the word being said. Set a field to **word audio** in the Anki panel on the Watch page. The audio comes from [JapanesePod101](https://www.japanesepod101.com/) or, if that has none, from [Lingua Libre](https://lingualibre.org/) recordings on Wikimedia Commons. Both are free, but you need an internet connection for this.

## Optional: GitHub token

Subtitles are also searched in a GitHub mirror. Without a token, GitHub allows only 60 requests per hour. If you use the app a lot, you can raise that limit with a [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) (it doesn't need any permissions):

**Windows (PowerShell)**
```
$env:GITHUB_TOKEN = "your_token_here"
npm start
```

**macOS / Linux**
```
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here npm start
```

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `'node' is not recognized` | Install Node.js, then open a new terminal. |
| `EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000` | The app (or another program) is already using port 3000. Close the other terminal, or change `port` in `server.js`. |
| `can't reach Anki` | Open Anki and check that AnkiConnect is installed. |
| Words don't show a definition | Wait until the terminal says `dictionary: … ready`. |
| `Cannot find module …` | Run `npm install` again. |

## Project structure

```
server.js        starts the local server (port 3000)

scripts/         the code that runs in the browser
index.html       watch page
reading.html     reading page
podcasts.html    listening page
data/            offline dictionary files
```
